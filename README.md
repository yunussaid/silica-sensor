# Silica Concentrate Soft Sensor Project

## Overview
This project implements a *Machine Learning Soft Sensor* to predict *% Silica Concentrate* in a mining flotation process. By analyzing real-time process variables (air flow, level, pulp density, etc.), the system predicts silica levels every minute, allowing operators to react to process changes immediately rather than waiting 60 minutes for physical lab results.

The final production model is built using *CatBoost*, selected for its superior generalization capability on future data.

2. Run training: `jupyter notebook soft_sensor.ipynb`

## Key Performance (Forward-in-Time Evaluation)
We prioritized the *85–15 Chronological Split* for model selection to simulate true production conditions (predicting real-time % Silica Concentrate in future use).
- *Model:* CatBoost Regressor
- *MAPE:* 19.7%
- *R²:* 0.62
- *MAE:* 0.48

> *Note on Evaluation Strategy:*
> The 85–15 split represents true forward-in-time generalization. While other models (like LightGBM) showed inflated scores (R² ~0.91) under a 1–59 split, those metrics rely on more so interpolating within the same hour where the lab target is constant and seen during training. 
>
> We chose the 85–15 split results for picking our final model because they reflect the actual difficulty of predicting silica across different months and operating regimes (that are not seen during trainig), providing a realistic expectation of real-time performance in a live plant.
